<h1>Welcome to my p5 projects page!</h1>

<p> Here you will find a variety of personal, experimental projects that I have been developing to grow my skills.</p>
<p> Some of my early experimentation has been created whilst working through the <a href="https://natureofcode.com/"> "Nature of Code"</a> by Daniel Shiffman.</p>
<p> I have prefixed these sections with 'p5' as these projects have utilised <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, which is a JavaScript library that includes a number of tools, that make it easy to experiment with dynamic and physics-based interaction.</p>

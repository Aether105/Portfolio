    <p>Hi, I'm Jayden Hewitt.</p>

    <p>I’m an 18-year-old aspiring software developer with a passion for coding, retro technology, and films. Although I do not have industry experience yet, I am eager to apply the skills I have gained through personal projects to a professional setting.</p>

    <p>Lately, I have been working with p5.js and Pixi.js to create interactive content and animations. I enjoy experimenting with how code can express ideas in a playful way.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I love exploring retro tech - from that of the NES to the ZX Spectrum +2 - and I’m often inspired by the design and limitations of it. I’m also a film enthusiast, and I find that storytelling, visuals, and atmosphere in cinema often spark new ideas for my projects.</p>

    <p>This portfolio is my space to document my learning journey, showcase experiments, and share the projects I am building as I work towards becoming a software developer.</p>

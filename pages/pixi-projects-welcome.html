<h1>Welcome to my PIXI projects page!</h1>

<p> Here you'll find a collection of my personal, experimental work.</p>
<p> These projects are a result of me adapting some of my earlier p5.js creations and leveraging the power of Pixi.js to develop my skills further.</p>
<p> I've prefixed these sections with 'pixi' as they were built using <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>, which is a rendering engine that allows for the creation of interactive graphic experiences, cross-platform applications, and games.</p>
